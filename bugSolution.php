The solution replaces the inefficient `for` loop with a more efficient alternative:

```php
$arrayLength = count($myArray);
for ($i = 0; $i < $arrayLength; $i++) {
    // ...
}
```

By calculating the array's length only once before the loop, this version avoids the unnecessary function call in each iteration, resulting in significantly improved performance, especially for large arrays.  Alternatively, a `foreach` loop could be used, which is often more readable and can be more efficient depending on usage:

```php
foreach ($myArray as $value) {
    // ...
}
```

The `foreach` loop avoids the manual index management of the `for` loop, making the code simpler and potentially faster if you don't need access to the numerical index of each element.
