This code uses a `for` loop to iterate over an array. However, it uses `count()` inside the loop condition. This is inefficient because `count()` recalculates the array size in every iteration.  It's also unnecessary because the loop variable `$i` already keeps track of the index.

```php
for ($i = 0; $i < count($myArray); $i++) {
    // ...
}
```
